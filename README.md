XX model by Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation with periodic boundary boundaries (PBC)

This code was used as a comparison to disordered MERA in the paper "Entanglement renormalization for disordered systems" by Andrew M. Goldsborough and Glen Evenbly. https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07652.

Performs an exact diagonalisation by JW. Based on the explanation in "Numerical study of the random dimerized XX spin-1/2 chain" by P. Henelius and S. M. Girvin. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.57.11457
